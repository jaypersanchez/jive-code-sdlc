# Intent Brief
- Feature/Change: Bootstrap Jive-Code SDLC repository
- Primary user story: As a team, we want a logic-first SDLC so devs can't ship code they can't explain.
- Success metric(s): All commits/PRs reference a Logic Node (L-###). Reviews verify reasoning.
- Constraints/Assumptions: Start with docs + checks; CLI may come later.
- Out-of-scope: Shipping a full CLI today.
